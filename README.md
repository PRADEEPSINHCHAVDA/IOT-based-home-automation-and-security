# IOT-based-home-automation-and-security

    ABSTRACT
Home is the place where human feels secure. Most of the quality time of a human is spent at home. For more security and comfort in it, home automation and security system is established. An IOT based system is implemented at home with several components which ensures the safety of the people living in it. This system can be accessed by mobile phone or any mobile communication device. UNO Arduino or MEGA Arduino is the main processing unit. The PIR motion sensors and obstacle sensors are used for scanning any kind of movement throughout the range of the house. Led and resistors, IP Camera, Buzzer, etc. will be used in order to warn the user about any unauthorized activities. Then, these signals will be received by microcontroller and sent as a message to the mobile communication devices.

    INTRODUCTION
IOT also known as “Internet of Things” describes the network of physical objects that are embedded with the sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of exchanging the data with systems and internet. IOT has helped us to communicate with the devices through signals. It is a system which is embedded with the sensors, electronic devices and continuously flowing signals which carries the information. It can be said as connecting these physical devices with the virtual world or internet. Smart word is now-a-days used with everything such as smart phone, smart car, smart home, smart robots, etc. 

    IOT IN HOME AUTOMATION AND SECURITY SYSTEM
As we already know, many of the smart home applications have been launched past few years. They have been giving us satisfying results throughout. Nowadays we can explicitly handle all the home appliances like tv, refrigerator, air conditioner, etc. with the help of just one remote control or our mobile communication device. As the technology increased voice recognition took place through which people don’t even have to press the buttons for remote control, everything works through the voice command. To make human life for comfortable and ease, this home automation systems have been launched which gives luxurious life to the human beings.


    IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECT
Instead of many technologies launched in the field of home automation, but things lack in the security system as the technology used by the thieves has also became smart. We have door lock system through which we can get an access to the doors, but it’s not a rule that thieves enter through the doors. People face a lot of problem keeping their valuables at home fearing from getting it stolen. Our project works in this direction. According to our project-idea, there will be sensors installed in the floor which will detect the suspicious motions in the house. We can enable the system through our mobile communication device. Whenever there will be a suspicious movement recorded, the details will be sent to all the authorized devices in the premises. There will be buzzer system fixed in the house which will be enabled during an emergency situation. Also, any kind of unauthorized device scanned by the system in the range of the house, the details will be sent immediately. Door magnetic lock system will also be fixed for more security.   

    LITERATURE SURVEY

This system uses mobiles or computers to control basic home control and function automatically through internet from anywhere around, an automated home is sometimes called a smart home. It uses the portable devices as a user interface. Portable device can communicate with home automation network through an Internet gate. This project aims at controlling home appliances via Smartphone using Wi-Fi as communication protocol and arduino uno. The user here will move directly with the system through a interface whereas home  appliances like lights, fan etc. are remotely controlled through it .It is meant to save the electric power and human energy.

    FEATURES
Remote Access,
Energy Management,
advanced security and safety,
theft control,
user freindly,
paltform independent.

    CONCLUSION

IoT technology has great impact in everyone’s everyday life. This project describes various  uses in home automation system to control and access the home appliances remotely through Internet services anywhere anytime. Several unlock issues related to privacy and security needs to be focused for future Internet of Things. Securing data, data management and privacy of every user plays a key role in the challenges of Internet of Things. As this projects works in the field of theft control, it ensures the safety of the members. As it is very easy to use, it can be installed anywhere. This systems alerts the members about any suspicious movement or unauthorised devices around even if the user is away from its home and this is the positive point for any theft control system.
